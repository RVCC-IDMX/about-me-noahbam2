# Description of project
### The project that I had done for my website was set as an example to outline what i've learned with each section containing different elements for an about me website. ive made sure that the design of the website and adaptivity was good for mobile first and any other device. ive made sure that the design of the website and adaptivity was good for mobile first and any other device.  I've implemented a navbar which takes me to different areas on my website for ease of access to different parts of the site. The biography highlights myself and what my hobbies are. A photo gallery highlighting some of my projects that I made for myself. I also made a video in which I captured footage of a test for the way light intereacts with ingame objects. I implemented some random text i found online to learn about flexing text to fit on screen for different devices. And last but not least a contact us section for when I learned about forms. I've done my best in making the style off the page consistent in color choises.
