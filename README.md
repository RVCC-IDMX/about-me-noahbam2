# Description of project
### The project that I had done for my website was set as an example to outline what i've learned with each section containing different elements for an about me website. I've made sure that the design of the website and adaptivity was good for mobile first and any other device. I've implemented an adaptive navbar that open and closes with indicating icons, which takes me to different areas on my website for ease of access.I've implemented my own Logo for the website title. The biography highlights myself and what my hobbies are also adaptive at different screen sizes. A photo gallery highlighting some of my projects that I made for myself which was a bit difficult because of the difference in sizes of the photos, it affected the way they stacked using the display flex. I also made a video in which I captured footage of a test for the way light intereacts with ingame objects. I implemented some random text I found online to learn about flexing text to fit on screen for different devices. A contact us section for when I learned about forms. And to wrap it up I gained skill in using the media queary with an attribute min-max width that tells the site when to shift to s a different screen setup.  I've done my best in making the style of the page consistent in color choise, design, and adaptability.
