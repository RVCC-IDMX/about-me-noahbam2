    <h2>The Picture of Dorian Gray</h2>

    <div>
        <p>"Leave me now," said a stern voice behind him.</p>

        <p>He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the
             dead man had been thrust back into the chair and that
              Campbell was gazing into a glistening yellow face.
               As he was going downstairs, he heard the key being
                turned in the lock.</p>

        <p>It was long after seven when Campbell came back into
             the library. He was pale, but absolutely calm.
              "I have done what you asked me to do," he muttered.
               "And now, good-bye. Let us never see each other again."
            </p>

        <p>"You have saved me from ruin, Alan. I cannot forget that,"
             said Dorian simply.</p>

        <p>It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the remains of really remarkable ugliness. She had proved an excellent wife to one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having buried her husband properly in a marble mausoleum, which she had herself designed, and married off her daughters to some rich, rather elderly men, she devoted herself now to the pleasures of French fiction, French cookery, and French esprit when she could get it.</p>
