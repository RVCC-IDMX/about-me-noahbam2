            Biography
        </h2>
    
        <p>
            My name is Noah Mcmahan, I've attended public school until the 7th grade, went to private school and then had attended Raritan Valley Community college
             to fullfill my Computer science major and to become a computer programmer
             working as a graphics desinger in a big company. I also aspire to be
              a frelancer for my own line of products that I make from procedural products.
               I currently make procedural art as a hobby to show friends and strangers my capabilities, it can also be included in my portfolio for finding job listings. 
               My personal projects have been showcased by others on twitter and other social media platforms.

    <h2>The Picture of Dorian Gray</h2>

    <div>
        <p>Gaming industries, Movie production studios, and practically any company who's dipping their toes into realism has most definitely used a
             technique for creating real
             world lighting called Raytracing. An article by NVidia put out a simplified way of explaining what raytracing is and what it does for the gaming and movie industry.
              The article sums up what it means to ray trace by stating that it basically simulates shadows, reflections, refractions, and indirect light using heavy computational
               power. It takes the camera (which is the view of the scene) and calculates the view ray through one pixel in the image and hits an object directly beaming into the
                light, which creates the image on screen. The View ray makes interactions with the 3d environment by passing through objects which might be reflective. Some rays
                 might make it through objects; thats semi-transparent or (refractive). Some of the light rays
             might bounce off an object and back into the camera to produce a reflective material. All internally
              producing a convincing image. An image by NVidia showcases how the process is done:

        <p>He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the
             dead man had been thrust back into the chair and that
              Campbell was gazing into a glistening yellow face.
               As he was going downstairs, he heard the key being
                turned in the lock.</p>

        <p>It was long after seven when Campbell came back into
             the library. He was pale, but absolutely calm.
              "I have done what you asked me to do," he muttered.
               "And now, good-bye. Let us never see each other again."
            </p>

        <p>"You have saved me from ruin, Alan. I cannot forget that,"
             said Dorian simply.</p>

        <p>It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the remains of really remarkable ugliness. She had proved an excellent wife to one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having buried her husband properly in a marble mausoleum, which she had herself designed, and married off her daughters to some rich, rather elderly men, she devoted herself now to the pleasures of French fiction, French cookery, and French esprit when she could get it.</p>
